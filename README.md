**Course Description**

This course is specifically designed to serve as a broad foundation for students from non-design backgrounds 
to give form to published content. This is a hands-on studio course that will begin with projects that investigate typography, image, composition, sequence, and order, with the aim to design and publish something that demonstrates a point of view by the end of the semester. Woven through the course will be a discussion of contemporary issues that cross design and publishing through an analysis of contemporary books, magazines, and periodicals across both printed and digital platforms.


**Learning Outcomes**

At the end of this course, students will be able to:
– Articulate the historical and contemporary role of design in publishing content in print and online
– Demonstrate comprehensive awareness of design systems, critical thinking, and cultural awareness
– Develop platform-independent design concepts
– Demonstrate basic abilities to form content through typography, image, layout, sequence and order
– Assess and incorporate feedback as part of an iterative design and publishing process
– Offer constructive feedback for others’ work

Some notes. 

1) Covid has impacted the way all of us work and learn. Maybe you have lost your job, or your employment situation has become more stressful and dangerous. Maybe you have or a loved one has been sick. Perhaps you have even lost someone close to you. Be forgiving of yourself and your fellow classmates, and do what you can to make this a community of learning in solidarity despite the storm outside.
2) This class is about synthesis. We will be covering theory, method, concept, and technique in equal proportions. While we will cover some skills, it is not a skills-training class.   
3) This class will require you to learn how to do a lot of things on your own. In the process, you will learn how to learn on your own, which is more valuable than anything else you learn in this class. You will be asked to do online tutorials and attempt to create things when it’s not yet proven that you can do it. You will have help, but you will be the person doing it, after which you will be able to do anything you don’t already know how to do. Be patient with yourself: you will have to repeat things over and over before getting it right. Simple things will be hard. 
4) You will also document your work and your ideas on a substack blog. If you prefer to keep this private so that it is only viewable in this class, you may make it subscription only.
5) Depending on your level of skill and experience, this class will require 2-4 hours of work outside of the scheduled class time. Please think about when you can do this work, and put it in your calendar if you can. Class time will be a mix of  all-class discussions, small group meetings, and asychronous lectures and tutorials. Outside of critiques, most weeks we will not meet together as a full class for more than an hour and a half.
6) Approach this class in the spirit of experimentation and learning. You may or may not have the chance again to develop and interrogate ideas in a community of like-minded peers. If you merely make work that is “correct,” all you will do is reinforce that notion.
